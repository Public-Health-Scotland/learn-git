I have learnt a lot in this course! I had heard about commiting, branches ect but found it very confsuing, this course has made it all make sense, thank you!

The delivery was great, and the order of going through things really made sense. 

The exercises really helped in cementing what was happening - maybe a shared-screen demonstration for the full set up pre-course would have really helped as i got a bit stuck trying to find all of the instructions in the info booklets.
