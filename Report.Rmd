## R Markdown

This is an example R Markdown document to be used in the Introduction to Git training course. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```



```
